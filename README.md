1. put the two halves of the modell together. There are two magnets on each side that connect to each other.
2. connect the arduino to a laptop/pc via usb-port (software can't start without the connection)
3. start .exe in application.windows32 or macOSX folder

Bordakreis Arduion contains the Arduino code of the project. 

To reupload the code to an arduino:
1. connect the aruino via usb to a pc/laptop
2. open the BordakreisArduino.ino file.
3. select the "upload" arrow on the upper left of the screen.
